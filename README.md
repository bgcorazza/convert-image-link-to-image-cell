# convert-image-link-to-image-cell

This code can be used on the [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) platform that uses JavaScript to automate tasks across Google products.

As the name says, this code is able to loop through the defined columns and convert images that are being displayed via the formula *(e.g. `=image("https://link.com/image.jpg")`)* and convert for an image inserted directly into the table cell.
